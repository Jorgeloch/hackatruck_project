# hackatruck project
This project consists of a non-invasive current sensor that sends consumption data to a database and one IOS app that is able to check the data form this database through an API and show them to the user in graphs.
This project was realized in group, during the passage of the Hackatruck project by the Federal University of Sergipe. My participation was associated to made the prototype and setup it to comunicate with the database. In addition, I had some participation in doing the screens design.
